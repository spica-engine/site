# Installation

Spica provides CLI to manage your instances on your local machine.

1. To install CLI, simply enter the following command to your terminal:

```shell
$ npm install @spica/cli -g
```

2. After CLI has been installed successfully, you can run a Spica instance on your local machine:

```shell
$ spica project start <instance name>
```

> Important: To run `start` command, you must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your development environment.

3. Accessible URL and credentials of your instance will appear on the console. After you logged in, you can start to develop your first project.
