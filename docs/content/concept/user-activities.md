# User Activity Logs

User Activity module gives you access to control each passport identities' activity logs. You can filter activity logs by identity, action type, module, date, or even document id. In a standard build of Spica, you can see all user activities in the one-month.

> NOTE: Activity logs that are older than one month will no longer exist.

To list all Spica users' activity, simply navigate to **Primary** -> **User Activities**
