# User Activity Logs

User Activity module gives you access to control each passport identities' activity logs. You can filter activity logs by identity, action type, module, date, or even document id. In a standard build of Spica, you can see all user activities without any time limitation.

> HINT: Because of no time limit on user activity logs, we suggest you clear user activities in a time interval. To accomplish this, you can create a function that clears the activity collection on a regular basis by using the **Schedule** trigger.

To list all Spica users' activity, simply navigate to **Primary** -> **User Activities**
