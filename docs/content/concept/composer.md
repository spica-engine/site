# Composer

## Important: The composer module is still under active development

The purpose of the composer module is to give the users to upload their front-end components and use them with data they have in harmony. Once you upload your components to NPM, you can import your components into your project. If your components have dependencies on another package from NPM, you can import other 3rd party libraries as well.

Everything in the composer module has been designed for decreasing cost and time. This is why adding a component is just two clicks in the composer module. You can make your front-end development even with a phone or tablet.

When you create a page with a composer, the system will generate a file. All HTML, typescript, CSS codes will be generated automatically using your components by the system. 

Once you save your changes, the real file will be updated. Until then, all changes will be made in memory. You can create multiple pages and create the whole frontend in composer. Links will be handled by the composer. 

In the composer module, you need to define a name, a short name, and a favicon. These names and favicons will be used for PWA build as well. Spica makes splash screen images automatically from favicon images.

## PWA, Mobile Applications, Web Apps

Once you finish your front end, you can build it as a mobile application and web application as well. Web applications will be exported as PWA automatically. The only thing that you need to do is giving an Application name for PWA builds.

## Fonts, Colors

To change fonts and colors, we provide a built-in theming structure in the composer module. So you can choose a built-in color palette or you can make your color palette. Also once you choose your color palette, you can update colors. 

Most of the popular fonts are in the system already. Also, you can import any font family from Google Fonts easily. 

## 3rd Parties

You can import 3rd party libraries (named as a collection) and also you can apply custom JS code. This custom code will be injected inside HTML head tags. 

> NOTE: Injecting code is very dangerous if you don’t know how to coding. We don’t do any checks on custom injected codes.
