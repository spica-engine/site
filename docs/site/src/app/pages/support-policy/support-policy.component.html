    We only offer support for our Managed Spica customers, customers paying for hourly support.
    However, you can ask for help on our
    <a
      href="https://join.slack.com/t/spica-engine/shared_invite/zt-9qix07sg-BxiOW9tBi8elYRQWcMTOKg"
      target="_blank"
      >Slack</a
    >
    or <a href="https://discord.gg/HJTrRMH" target="_blank">Discord</a> community if you are using
    open source licenses!

  <p>
    For issues with Spica itself, chances are submitting a Bug Report is the best course or action.
    If you believe you have found an issue with the Spica, API, SDK, or Documentation â€” please head
    over to
    <a href="https://github.com/spica-engine/spica" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to fill out a Bug
    Report on the appropriate repository.
