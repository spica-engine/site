  <h3>Usage Policy</h3>
  <p>
    This Usage Policy is a key part of the agreement between you and Teknodev LTD (the managing
    entity of Managed Spica), which regulates your use of the Managed Spica service. If you do not
    agree with this Usage Policy, do not use any of Managed Spica services. The limits outlined
    below apply only to current plans. If the limits within your Enterprise Tier Service Agreement
    differ from those below, the Service Agreement supersedes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The usage of API requests and the Asset bandwidth is measured on a calendar monthly basis. Usage
    is reset on the first day of each month. For example, if you signed up on the 15th, your usage
    period is set to be from 15th to 1th of a calendar month. Additional API requests will be billed
    at $5 per 1,000,000 API requests (included internal function requests) per month. Additional
    asset bandwidth consumption will be billed at $25 per 250GB per month. The fees are applied
    after the initial metrics above are exceeded. All API requests are included in this metric,
    including those being sent when using the Admin App. Usage limits can only be exceeded if your
    organization has a valid payment method on file.
