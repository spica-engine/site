    you do not agree with the technical limitations described below then do not use any of the
    Managed Spica services. Teams are subject to the following cumulative limits:

  <p>
    If your organization requires higher limits, you can upgrade to an Enterprise tier, which allows
    for customizing individual limits. If your Organization's usage exceeds the technical limits, we
    reserve the right to take corrective action, including but not limited to the throttling of API
    or suspending/terminating your account.
